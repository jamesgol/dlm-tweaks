== Description ==

Some simple tweaks to the Download Monitor plugin.  Some of them are hopefully only temporary till the changes make it into the plugin.

* Allow multiple file extensions for the same version of file to be downloaded from the same endpoint (ie: pdf and docx)
* Allow the 'downloads' shortcode to use AND and OR for tag and exclude_tag in addition to category
* Allow the 'download' shortcode to pass the name instead of the ID number
